# SymFrames
A basic World of Warcraft (classic) addon that can be used to symmetrically adjust player
and enemy name plates without distorting a "vanilla" GUI. You might also goof your friends by uncommenting a few lines and including a .tga photo file of your own.

Might be some problems restoring saved settings. I've not played classic since release week so I can't fix bugs or otherwise improve this addon any longer.
